# Ractive.js and vert.x integration over the event bus

Small proof of concept project for fetching data for a client side Ractive.js application, from a vert.x based server backend. Data is transferred via the event bus provided by the vert.x platform.

It's based on the vert.x [Gradle build template](http://vertx.io/gradle_dev.html) and Ractive.js own ["Comments"](http://examples.ractivejs.org/comments) simple example.

For the whole description see [this blog post.](http://tryingthings.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/ractive-js-and-vert-x-integration-over-the-event-bus/) and of course on the pages of [vert.x](http://vertx.io/) and [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/).
